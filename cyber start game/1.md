So basically, you start off by opening a virtual machine, in VMware, using a virtual machine file that they have provided.
The file that you click on specifically is called cs_game.vmx

You can use virtual box, they do provide a virtual machine file for it, but generally I'd prefer VMware over Virtual box, though you may have to use it, as it is the only option available on Mac.

Make sure you have VMware installed though. I installed it by first downloading the bundle from their website for Ubuntu, while also making sure to have previously run "sudo apt install gcc build-essential -y", and then doing "sudo bash [filename of the file that you downloaded]"

When you're actually trying to run it however, make sure that you have virtualisation enabled on your CPU, like AMD-V
I did it by going to BIOS settings using the DEL button when booting up, and then going to the overclocking section, then to CPU features or something, then a selection called SVM (Secure Virtual Machine), and enable it, save, and exit, after this you can click on cs_game.vmx and might not work still...

If it doesn't work, it may ask to run it as an executable or something, in which case just open it with VMware, by right clicking and that stuff
It will work this time

The username and password is agent/agent respectively.

The software that comes pre-installed on the virtual machine file that they have provided are: Chrome, VS code, GIMP and gHex (a hex editor), the standard stuff

I also did "sudo pacman neofetch", just because it's a nice way to start
