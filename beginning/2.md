Well, the python was basic and easy, but a new thing I was introduced to was the sockets implementation in Python:

First you need to do `import sleep` to import a library to use.

Then you construct either a client or server socket, let's start with client.
`client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
AF_INET means you're connecting to an IPv4 IP address, and SOCK_STREAM means you're connecting to a TCP connection rather than UDP.
SOCK_DGRAM is UDP, in which you send one message, get a reply, and the connection terminates.

You then connect to the server:
`client.connect(("IP", PORT_NUMBER))`
You replace IP and PORT_NUMBER with an IP address and a 4 digit port number obviously.

To receive data you do:
`data = client.recv(1024)`
Receives 1024 bytes, the maximum amount that can be received.
And then you can just print it, it'll probably be a string or whatever other response from the server.

Then to make a server it's pretty simple as well:
```
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.bind(("IP", PORT_NUMBER))
server.listen(NUMBER)
```
The 2nd line binds to the specified IP and port number, and the next line is the maximum amount of users it listens to.

Then you need to setup an infinite loop so that it continuously listens for incoming connections:
```
while True:
  connection, address = server.accept() //if the server gets a new connection, save it, and save the connection and its address in those variables
  
  data = connection.recv(1024) //receive 1024 bytes
  
  if len(data) > 0:
    print(data) //prints the data if it is longer than 0
```

Then you can simply do `connection.close()` to close the connection, and `server.close()` to close the server socket.

By the way, Python sockets are by default, in blocking mode, so will wait for a response from, say, recv, before moving on.
